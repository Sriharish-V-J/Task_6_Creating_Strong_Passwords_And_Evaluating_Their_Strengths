# Task_6_Creating_Strong_Passwords_And_Evaluating_Their_Strengths

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To understand what makes a password strong and test several passwords using free tools to evaluate their strength and susceptibility to attacks.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- [Password Strength Checker](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [How secure is my password?](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

## ðŸ“Œ Steps To Be Followed:

1. Create passwords with varying complexity.

   > A sample text file '' containg multiple passwords with varying complexity is provided for reference. 
   
2. Test all passwords on the given tools (or any suitable one) to recive feedback about their strength and reliability

   > The feedback recieved and the amount of time (may vary) that will be potentially spent to crack some of the passwords listed in the sample file is provided below. 

| Password          | Score (%) | Crack Time | Feedback                          |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| 123456            | 4%       | <1 sec     | Too short, lacks complexity       |
| Password123       | 50%       | <1 sec| Missing special characters        |
| Pa$$w0rd!2024     | 100%       | 3 hours  | Great use of complexity           |
| T!mE@T0$g0N0w#91  | 100%      | centuries  | Extremely strong and random       |

## Common password attacks:
   - **Brute Force**: All combinations tried until correct password found.
   - **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common wordlists (like `123456`, `qwerty`).
   - **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials on multiple sites.

---

## Tips for strong passwords:
   - Use 12+ characters
   - Avoid real words or names
   - Mix upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Donâ€™t reuse passwords
   - Use a password manager

## Conclusion
   The above task is to showcase how to generate passwords of varying complexity and how to utilize password checkers to evaluate their strength. A small amount of change can bring drastic changes to the passwords' strength.
